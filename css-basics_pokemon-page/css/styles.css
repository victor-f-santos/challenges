/* The exercise will start here! Sometimes you may need to add a class attribute to some elements in your HTML structure, but otherwise it won't be necessary to adjust the HTML to solve the tasks. */

/* ------- General Styles ------- */

* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

body {
  font-family: monospace;
  font-size: 1rem;
  line-height: 1.5;
  background-color: LemonChiffon;
}

/* ------- Headings Part 1 ------- */

/* Task 3: To set the line height to 1.5 is good for texts, because of accessibility concerns, but for the headings it seems too much. Let's change this by giving our headings a line height of 1.2: */

/* your solution */

h1 {
  line-height: 1.2;
}

.title {
  background-color: white;
  margin-top: 0;
  padding: 10px;
  text-align: center;
}

section {
  background-color: white;
  padding: 20px;
  margin: 10px;
  border-left: 5px solid orange;
}

.favourites {
  border-left: 5px solid gold;
}
/* ------- Headings Part 2 ------- */

/* Task 6: The headings of our sections somehow look boring. Therefore, we want to change this:

- We want a border to the left and the right of the title only. The border should be 3px solid with the color "gold".)
- There should be some space between the characters and the border.
- The right border should end with the last character of the title. Hint: If you don't know how to do this, think about the display property.
- Bonus: The color of the border of "Favourite Pok√©mon" should be "orange". Hint: You may need another CSS rule.

.subtitle {
  border-left: 3px solid gold;
  border-right: 3px solid orange;
  padding: 5px;
}

.subtitle:first-child {
  border-right: 3px solid gold;
}
/* ------- List ------- */

/* Task 7: Last but not least! We want to style our list with our favorite Pok√©mon. Which selector do we need? And also add values for the padding. */

/* add selector */
ul {
  list-style: "üß°";
  padding-left: 20px;
}

/* add selector */
li {
  padding-left: 10px;
}

/* ------- The End -------- */

.image-fluid {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}

/* Note: After finishing all tasks this class should also work. This means that the image should flexibly adjust its size to the width of the viewport. */
